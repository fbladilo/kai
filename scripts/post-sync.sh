# Regenerate Hermeto-compatible requirements files for kai_mcp_solution_server.
#
# Invoked by dymurray/mta-sync after a successful merge from konveyor/kai so
# the hash-locked requirements.txt stays in step with upstream pyproject.toml
# changes (upstream commits an unhashed file; .gitattributes merge=ours keeps
# our copy on merge, and this script refreshes it). Also runs in CI via
# .github/workflows/verify-requirements-txt.yml as the drift detector.
#
# requirements-build-constraints.txt pins wheel-only build deps to a sdist-
# bearing version because pybuild-deps can't introspect wheels.
